        A <b>website</b> (also written as <b> web site</b>) is a collection of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page</a> and
        related content that is identified by a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"> domain name
        </a>and published
        on at least one web server. Notable examples are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">
            wikipedia.org</a>,

        All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"> World Wide
            Web</a>. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet">private network</a>, such as a company's internal website for
        its employees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as
        news, education, commerce, entertainment, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking">social

    <p>
        Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops,
        laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called
        a web browser.

        <h3>Overview
            <hr>
        </h3>
        <p>Websites can be used in various fashions: a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government
            website, an organization website, etc. Websites can be the work of an individual, a business or other
            organization, and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose. Any website can contain a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" title="Hyperlink">hyperlink</a> to any other website, so
            the distinction between individual sites, as perceived by the user, can be blurred.
        </p>
        <p>Some websites require user registration or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription"
                title="Subscription">subscription</a> to access content. Examples of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall" title="Paywall">subscription websites</a> include many
            business sites, news websites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"
                title="Academic journal">academic journal</a> websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum" title="Internet forum">message boards</a>, web-based
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking" title="Social networking">social networking</a>
            websites, websites providing real-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market"
                title="Stock market">stock market</a> data, as well as sites providing various other services.
        </p>
        <p>While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized "Web site", since "Web" is a proper noun
            when referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World
                Wide Web</a>), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the standard spelling. All
            major style guides, such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style"
                    title="The Chicago Manual of Style">The Chicago Manual of Style</a></i> and the <i><a

        <h3>Static website
            <hr>
        </h3>
        <p>A static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web
            browser. It is primarily coded in <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language"
                title="Hypertext Markup Language">Hypertext Markup Language</a> (HTML); <a
                href="/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="Cascading Style Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) are
            used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and
            as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered "static" content if it plays
            automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to
            all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will
            generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website
            owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and
            may require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such
            as <i>classic website</i>, a <i>five-page website</i> or a <i>brochure website</i> are often static
            websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information
            about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation
            menus.
        </p>
        <p>Static websites may still use <a href="/wiki/Server_side_include" title="Server side include">server side
                includes</a> (SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages. As
            the site's behavior <i>to the reader</i> is still static, this is not considered a dynamic site.

        <p>A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. Server-side dynamic

            websites.
        </p>

        <p>A site can display the current state of a dialogue between users, monitor a changing situation, or provide
            information in some way personalized to the requirements of the individual user. For example, when the front
            page of a news site is requested, the code running on the webserver might combine stored HTML fragments with
            news stories retrieved from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" title="Database">database</a>
            or another website via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" title="RSS">RSS</a> to produce a page
            that includes the latest information. Dynamic sites can be interactive by using <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_forms" title="HTML forms">HTML forms</a>, storing and reading
            back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookies" title="Browser cookies">browser cookies</a>, or
            by creating a series of pages that reflect the previous history of clicks. Another example of dynamic
            content is when a retail website with a database of media products allows a user to input a search request,
            e.g. for the keyword <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatles" title="Beatles">Beatles</a>. In
            response, the content of the web page will spontaneously change the way it looked before, and will then
            display a list of Beatles products like CDs, DVDs, and books. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML" title="Dynamic HTML">Dynamic HTML</a> uses <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code to instruct the
            web browser how to interactively modify the page contents. One way to simulate a certain type of dynamic
            website while avoiding the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection
            basis is to periodically automatically regenerate a large series of static pages.

        <p>Websites can be divided into two broad categories—static and interactive. Interactive sites are part of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a> community of sites and allow for
            interactivity between
            the site owner and site visitors or users. Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow
            engagement with the audience or users directly. Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts
            or for personal use or entertainment. Many websites do aim to make money, using one or more business models,
            including:

            Some websites may be included in one or more of these categories. For example, a business website may
            promote the business's products, but may also host informative documents, such as <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper" title="White paper">white papers</a>. There are also
            numerous sub-categories to the ones listed above. For example, a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porn" title="Porn">porn</a> site is a specific type of e-commerce
            site or business site (that is, it is trying to sell memberships for access to its site) or have social
            networking capabilities. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansite" title="Fansite">fansite</a> may
            be a dedication from the owner to a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity"
                title="Celebrity">celebrity</a>. Websites are constrained by architectural limits (e.g., the computing
            power dedicated to the website). Very large websites, such as Facebook, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google employ
            many servers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)"
                title="Load balancing (computing)">load balancing</a> equipment such as <a

            visitor loads over multiple computers at multiple locations. As of early 2011, Facebook utilized 9 data

            In February 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcraft" title="Netcraft">Netcraft</a>, an <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_monitoring" title="Website monitoring">Internet
                monitoring</a> company that has tracked Web growth since 1995, reported that there were 215,675,903
            websites with domain names and content on them in 2009, compared to just 19,732 websites in August 1995.
            After reaching 1 billion websites in September 2014, a milestone confirmed by NetCraft in its October 2014
            Web Server Survey and that Internet Live Stats was the first to announce—as attested by this tweet from the
            inventor of the World Wide Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee—the number of websites in the world have
            subsequently declined, reverting to a level below 1 billion. This is due to the monthly fluctuations in the
            count of inactive websites. The number of websites continued growing to over 1 billion by March 2016 and has
            continued growing since. Netcraft Web Server Survey in January 2020 reported that there are 1,295,973,827
            websites and in April 2021 reported that there are 1,212,139,815 sites across 10,939,637 web facing
            computers, and 264,469,666 unique domains. However, 85 percent of all websites are reportedly inactive and
            only 10-15 percent are in use.
